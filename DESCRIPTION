Description: A model for the growth of self-limiting populations using three, four, or five parameter 
    functions, which have wide applications in a variety of fields.
    The dependent variable in a dynamical modeling could be the population size at time x, 
    where x is the independent variable. In the analysis of quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
    (qPCR), the dependent variable would be the fluorescence intensity and the independent variable 
    the cycle number. This package then would calculate the TWW cycle threshold.
